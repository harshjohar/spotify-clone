# Spotify clone

This is not actually a clone, this can be used as a remote control for spotify in some other device.

This is because the spotify api is built in such a way that it only allows you to control the music, not play on any random client.

The rewind and forward doesnt work properly because when we load a song, only that song is added to queue, not the whole playlist, that is one thing which i need to figure out yet.
